Given a linked list where in addition to the next pointer, each node has a child pointer, which may or may not point to a separate list. 
These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure.
You are given the head of the first level of the list. 
Flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level linked list. 
You need to flatten the list in way that all nodes at first level should come first, then nodes of second level, and so on.
